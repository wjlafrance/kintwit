## KinTwit

KinTwit is a Twitter client webapp for extremely primitive web browsers, such as your phone from 1993, or your eInk-based Kindle.

### Wow, big project for an initial commit.
I had my Twitter keys in-lined in the code. I spent a few hours trying to rebase and gave up. I'm sorry. :(

### Where can I see this thing live?
kintwit.heroku.com

### How can I configure it to run my own installation?
Set your environment variables SECRET_TOKEN, CONSUMER_KEY and CONSUMER_SECRET to your token generated by Rails, and your key and secret from the Twitter developer resources.
